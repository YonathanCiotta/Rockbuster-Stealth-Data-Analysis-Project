## Introduction:
Rockbuster Stealth LLC: A Global Movie Rental Company

Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a prominent movie rental company that once operated physical stores worldwide, now faces intense competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. To remain competitive, the Rockbuster Stealth management team has devised a strategic plan: leveraging their existing movie licenses, they aim to launch an online video rental service.

As a data analyst within the Business Intelligence (BI) department, our primary responsibility is to load all relevant Rockbuster data into a robust Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). Subsequently, we employed SQL to analyze this data, providing data-driven answers to ad-hoc business inquiries from various departments.

## Key Questions and Objectives: 

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board wants data-driven answers for their 2020 company strategy.
They have specific questions:
Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
What was the average rental duration for all videos?
Where are Rockbuster customers based (by country)?
Where are customers with high lifetime value located?
Do sales figures vary across geographic regions?

## Data Set:

The data set is around 3MB and consists of several files.
Relationships exist between tables based on shared column names.
